// Note on _atomic_futex_small:
// Every 8 bit value is inside some aligned 32 bit value that doesn't cross a page boundary, same for 16 bit
// C standard might say loading this 32 bit value is UB and to that I say BITE ME
// We use volatile here to break the compiler's assumptions about memory
// This does not "fix" the UB, but does make the UB mostly non-actionable to the compiler in practice
// If you sacrifice performance for "idiomatic correctness" you are a sucker and PRs as such will not be accepted
// We use bitset to guarantee that wake ops will wakes the correct thread, even if multiple threads are waiting
//   on the same 32 bit word but different 8/16 bit portions of that word

// _atomic_futex32 is just normal futexes
// _atomic_futex64 has to be emulated via a waiter pool: each "waiter" tracks the wake "generation" to avoid lost wakes between the check and the actual syscall
//   (this only breaks if there have been exactly 2^32 wakes between the check and the syscall which is virtually impossible in practice)
// _atomic_futex64 also makes use of bitset to reduce unnecessary wakeups (from 1-in-32 to 1-in-1024)
// The exact same algorithm used by _atomic_futex64 can be used to implement wait for arbitrary sizes or conditions
